# Davonne's Disney Inspired Project Portfolio

The Disney Channel will always hold a special place in my heart. From watching Thats so Raven, Lizzie Mcguire, to movies like Brink, Camp Rock and Johnny Tsunami. Disney will always be part of my life, shaping who I am today.

I decided to take it back and create a clone of the old Disney Site, but with my own twist, to create a portfolio project showing my work as a dev.
